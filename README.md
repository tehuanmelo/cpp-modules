# C++ Projects - 42 School

Welcome to the world of C++ programming at 42 School! In these modules, you'll embark on a journey into the realm of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C++. C++, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, is a versatile and high-level programming language that extends the capabilities of the C programming language, often referred to as "C with Classes."

## Introduction

The primary aim of these modules is to introduce you to the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This serves as the foundation of your C++ journey. While there are various languages recommended for learning OOP, we have chosen C++ due to its close relationship with C, which you may already be familiar with. To keep things manageable, your code will adhere to the C++98 standard.

It's essential to note that modern C++ has evolved significantly in many aspects. If you aspire to become a proficient C++ developer, it's up to you to explore advanced C++ concepts and features beyond the 42 Common Core.

## General Rules

### Compiling

- Compile your code with `c++` and the following flags: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
- Your code should still compile when the flag `-std=c++98` is added.

### Formatting and Naming Conventions

- Exercise directories will be named as follows: `ex00`, `ex01`, ..., `exn`.
- Name your files, classes, functions, member functions, and attributes as required in the guidelines.
- Use UpperCamelCase for class names. Files containing class code should follow the class name format (e.g., `ClassName.hpp/ClassName.h`, `ClassName.cpp`, or `ClassName.tpp`).
- Output messages should end with a newline character and be displayed to the standard output.
- Coding style is not strictly enforced, but readability and clean code are essential.

### Allowed/Forbidden

- You are allowed to use almost everything from the standard library. Utilize C++-ish versions of C functions where applicable.
- External libraries like C++11, Boost libraries, *printf(), *alloc(), and free() are forbidden.
- Unless explicitly allowed, avoid using `using namespace <ns_name>` and the `friend` keyword.

### Design Requirements

- Avoid memory leaks when allocating memory using the `new` keyword.
- Design your classes in the Orthodox Canonical Form from Module 02 to Module 09, unless specified otherwise.
- Functions implemented in header files (excluding function templates) result in a grade of 0.
- Ensure headers can be used independently and include all necessary dependencies with proper include guards to prevent double inclusion.

### Read Me

- You can add additional files if needed for code organization.
- Pay attention to exercise examples, as they may imply requirements not explicitly mentioned in the instructions.
- Read each module thoroughly before starting your work.
- Use your problem-solving skills and think critically.

## Conclusion

You will be working on various projects, each requiring the implementation of multiple classes. While it may seem overwhelming, scripting your favorite text editor can help streamline the process. You have a certain degree of freedom to complete the exercises, but adhering to the mandatory rules and avoiding laziness is essential. The journey through these projects is an opportunity to learn and apply valuable concepts in C++.

By adhering to these guidelines and staying diligent, you'll gain a strong foundation in C++ and Object-Oriented Programming. Enjoy your exploration of the fascinating world of C++ and OOP at 42 School!
